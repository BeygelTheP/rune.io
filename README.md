# Rune.io
It's my training game developing project. I saw some .io games and wished to make one
on my own. It's still nothing to discuss about gameplay, because i'm  still stabilizing
back/front-end interaction.

### Technology stack
- [zaphoyd/WebSocketPP](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp)
- [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)
  - Asio, Threads, Multi-Index, Circular Buffer and other very helpful libraries
- [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) v3.1.0
- [Google Closure Library](https://developers.google.com/closure/library/)

### Test server
I'm running test server with my current in-development build on [runeio.wenye.ru](http://runeio.wenye.ru/).
It may be not available at night in Moscow, but it's usually working at daytime. Also it can be broken, because
I can work on it right at the time.
